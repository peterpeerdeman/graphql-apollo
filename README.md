Peter is a passionate technical director representing a team of talented software engineers and designers at Lifely. With a team of 25 they bring ideas to life as your digital department, with expertise in product design, development and devops. Whenever Peter is not high-fiving the team or discussing technical decisions with partners and clients he loves to produce electronic music and take pretty pictures.

You have probably integrated a fair share of REST APIs in your frontend applications. Ever wished you could decide for yourself what combination of data and fields the backend should return? GraphQL is an API language that allows backend teams to expose strongly typed, automatically documented APIs that are a joy for any frontend team to work with.

Peter will briefly introduce GraphQL and its benefits, demo one of the many production GraphQL applications Lifely has created in the past years and dive a little deeper into the possibilities of Apollo for React and GraphQL Subscriptions.
