GraphQL, Apollo and Optimistic UI updates, by Peter Peerdeman (https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterpeerdeman/)

Peter is CTO at Lifely which creates web applications from concept to development and deployment using React, Apollo, GraphQL and NodeJS.

GraphQL has been a great replacement for REST API's in recent projects at the Lifely office. It offers an amazing abstraction over the available datamodel and allows the frontend views to be extremely flexible. Apollo helps the React components get their required data through GraphQL endpoints and has some awesome UI optimizations that we'd love to share, after kickstarting you with some GraphQL/Apollo basics.

This talk was given on 20-02-2018 as a talk at the [Frontend Forward meetup "APIs Anonymous" at the Voorhoede](https://www.meetup.com/Front-end-Forward/events/242532650/)
